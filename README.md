# Image Classification using Keras

In this notebook I have used a **Deep Learnig Model for Image Classification.**
This Image Classification is between **Emergency and Non-Emergency Vehicles.**
This model can be used by traffic cameras to create green passages for Emergency vehicles. This can be crucial in saving time and can improve emergency response time!

I have used a CNN architechture and have tuned the hyperparamters to further improve my model.
I was able to bring the accuracy from **~71% to ~84%.**
